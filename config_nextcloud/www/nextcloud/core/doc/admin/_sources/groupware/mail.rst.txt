Account delegation
------------------

The Mail app supports account delegation if the delegation is handled by the mail server. That means the mail server has to accept emails sent from an alias address.

In mailcow, for example, the setting is called *Also allowed to send as user*.

.. warning:: Unless paired with shared *Sent* mailboxes or handled otherwise by the mail server, sent messages will be stored in the sender's personal *Sent* mailbox.
